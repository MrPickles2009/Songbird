**Songbird** is a web app that pulls api data from music streaming websites in order to create a customised music discovery. This app was created as a prototype for my **Software Development** ([ISAT 340](https://code4your.life/syllabi/isat-340/)) class at **James Madison University**. The goal for this class was to walk us through the software development process from problem statements and mockups to a working protoype.

We chose [electron](https://electronjs.org/) for its incredible cross-platform abilities as well as the fact that our team was knowledgeable in JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
